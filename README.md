[poster.pdf](https://github.com/AlumaElia/SmartHome/files/10715938/poster.pdf) 

Introduction

This project presents the design and implementation of a home automation system integrated with an IoT application. The system consists of two smart systems: a smart light and a smart boiler. The system is built using the ESP8266 microcontroller and a UI developed using the Kivy framework. The system allows users to control and monitor these two devices from anywhere, at any time, through a user-friendly app.

Design

The home automation system consists of two main components: the hardware and the software. The hardware component includes an ESP8266 microcontroller, sensors, and actuators for the smart light and smart boiler. The software component consists of a UI developed using the Kivy framework and an IoT application that communicates with the hardware component over a local network.

The ESP8266 microcontroller used in the system is a powerful and low-cost microcontroller with built-in WiFi capabilities, making it ideal for use in an IoT application. The sensors and actuators are connected to the microcontroller using a simple GPIO interface, allowing for easy integration with the microcontroller.

The Kivy UI is built using the Kivy framework, a powerful open-source library for developing cross-platform UIs. The UI is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, allowing users to control and monitor the smart light and smart boiler from anywhere, at any time.

Implementation

The hardware component of the home automation system was implemented by connecting the ESP8266 microcontroller, sensors, and actuators for the smart light and smart boiler according to the circuit diagram. The software for the microcontroller was written in Python using the PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The software handles the communication between the sensors and actuators and the IoT app.

The Kivy UI was developed using the Kivy framework and it communicates with the ESP8266 microcontroller using the MQTT protocol. The communication between the UI and the microcontroller is facilitated by a Mosquitto broker. The UI was implemented in Python using the PyCharm IDE. It allows users to control and monitor the smart light and smart boiler, and it also provides real-time updates on the status of these devices.

Conclusion

The home automation system integrated with an IoT application provides a convenient solution for controlling and monitoring the smart light and smart boiler. The system is easy to use and provides users with complete control over these two devices, from anywhere, at any time. This project demonstrates the potential for integrating IoT technology into home automation systems and using Python and Kivy for the development of the UI and the IoT app. The use of the Mosquitto broker facilitates communication between the UI and the microcontroller. It provides a useful starting point for further development and improvement.
